# Door-Open-Close-Prediction

Here we will try to predict whether the images is of close/open door. The idea behind this methos is simple and it works on method of prediction of Cat vs Dog. The way we are try to predict cat vs dog , it is based on similar manner.

### Generate own dataset:
Here we will generate our own dataset by using only 'Two image' and will store it 'train' folder . We need only one folder to work and will split into train-test split. Performance level gets check on test data.

Code will generate dataset for closed image door till data_samples. Download the image from below sources.
