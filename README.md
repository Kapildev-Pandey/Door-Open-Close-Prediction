# Door-Open-Close-Prediction

Here we will try to predict whether the images is of close/open door. The idea behind this methos is simple and it works on method of prediction of Cat vs Dog. The way we are try to predict cat vs dog , it is based on similar manner.

Cat vs Dog dataset available in internet. But here we will generate our own dataset of close and open door images as I didn't found any public dataset. We will take images and will work on it.

### Generate own dataset:
Here we will generate our own dataset by using only 'Two image' and will store it 'train' folder . We need only one folder to work and will split into train-test split. Performance level gets check on test data.

Code will generate dataset for closed image door till data_samples. Download the image from below sources.

We will also do other works like labelinng and more by using method:

**Requirements:**

1.Numpy

2.Keras

I didn't found someone work related to this dataset so I tried it my own way.

**Some more useful resources:**

1.Github

2.Medium.com

3.Youtube

etc.

**Note:** We just need idea based on how Dog vs Cats prediction work on CNN and different way to write code. You have to just type 'Dog vs Cat in CNN' and  you will get plenty of resources. And work on our own dataset.


Output you can see in jupyter notebook.
